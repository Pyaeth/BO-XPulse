# X-Pulse project
#### --> Backend of the project (current): [BO-XPulse](https://github.com/Pyaeth/BO-XPulse)
#### --> Frontend of the project (in Angular 6): [xpulseFrontEnd](https://github.com/Pyaeth/xpulseFrontEnd)

### Project description
#### General purpose
X-Pulse is a work-in-progress web app which is meant to facilitate monitoring your userâ€™s finances. Simply put, Xpulse should give you statistical data based on your bank account statements, which can be uploaded in the app. A work-in-progress step here is to introduce a machine-learning algorithm in order to improve data analysis, so that the entire statistical system will eventually work accurately regardless of the bank (and therefore, of the statement formatting).
#### Technical specs
X-Pulse is a full-stack Spring Boot web application designed in respect with MVC architecture, component separation on the Angular side, use of node packages such as Chart.js and MDBootstrap. 

_**Maven**_ profiles are used to differentiate between development and production environments so that _**application.properties**_ are specific to the environment. In addition to this, _**log4j2**_ is configured to use a system environment variable so that the logging folder is environment based (e.g.: development happens on a _**Windows 10**_ machine while production is held on a Linux-based system and logs are stored on an external HDD in order to reduce SD-card usage of the _**Raspberry Pi**_).
#### Technologies used
- **Front-End**: Angular 6, Material-Design Bootstrap, Chartjs, HTML&CSS, node.js, npm
- **Back-End**: Spring Boot App, Java 8
- **Build tool**: Maven 3
- **Application server**: Apache Tomcat 9
- **Version management**: Git
- **Database**: MariaDB
#### Presented statistical data
-	Selected timeframe of reference (daily, monthly, yearly) comparisons of transactions and balance
-	Transactions can be shown in terms of number of transactions or in terms of amounts transactioned
-	Chart data contains categories of spendings (built using Chart.js)
- Selectable currency
### Further feature development
-	Several bank accounts per user
-	Tailored experience: get individual tips based on statistics to improve savings
-	Starting from a default list of categories for chart data, this list will later become user-customizable and each user will get to choose if he wants to keep this custom-made category private or share it with the other users
- Implementation of machine-learning mechanism to support several types of bank account statements
- Upload of shopping receipt for a more detailed report of spendings (also by phone -> to be discussed: mobile app development)
